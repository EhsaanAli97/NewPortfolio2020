						<p>
							This is my personal portfolio, which was designed and developed by
							myself. I used various different tools to create the final
							product. <br />
							<br />
							The technologies/languages used are as followed: <br />
							- HTML. <br />
							- CSS. <br />
							- SCSS. <br />
							- JavaScript. <br />
							- Moqups (Online Mockup, Wireframe and UI Prototyping Tool).
							<br />
							- VSCode. <br />
							- Photoshop. <br />
							<br />
							This website was developed after the completion of 'Responsive Web
							Design', 'JavaScript Algorithms' and 'Front-End Libraries' units
							in FreeCodeCamp. I decided to put my knowledge of HTML, CSS and
							JavaScript to the test and my end product is the website you're
							currently browsing. My portfolio website has recently been
							updated, incorporating SASS workflow, allowing to keep things more
							organised and creating style sheets much more efficiently.

						</div>
						<p>
							After completing the FreeCodeCamp units on React, I decided to
							create an application in React which tracked all the Covid-19
							cases, including: people infected, people recovered and deaths
							occuring from covid-19. This app uses information from an api I
							found online, converting it from JSON format to readable data,
							which is displayed as a graph. Alot of features from React had
							been used, such as React Hooks i.e. useState, useEffect and etc.
							<br />
							<br />
							The technologies/languages used are as followed: <br />
							- HTML. <br />
							- CSS. <br />
							- JavaScript. <br />
							- JSX <br />
							- React <br />
							- MaterialUI <br />
							- Axios <br />
							- ChartJs <br />
							- VSCode. <br />

						</div>
						<p>
							An e-commerce web application developed via React - Context API.
							It was heavily focused on understanding how an e-commerce website
							operates and the functionality it consists of. After creating this
							application, I have understood how a web application can boost
							business sales by just allowing customers to complete their
							purchase online â€“ leading to a repeat sale for the business.
							<br />
							<br />
							The e-commerce web application was developed with a mobile first
							approach. Bootstrap was used in order to set styling to each
							component, as well as being mobile responsive. The web application
							is responsive in all sizes, from XL displays to XS displays.

							<br />
							<br />
							The technologies/languages used are as followed: <br />
							- HTML. <br />
							- CSS. <br />
							- JavaScript. <br />
							- JSX <br />
							- React - Context API <br />
							- Bootstrap <br />
							- Styled Components <br />
							- Node.js <br />
							- VSCode. <br />

						<p>
							A Web application developed via React. After completing 2 previous
							projects in React, I wanted a better grasp of how components work
							in React as well as an alternative to Redux for state management.
							This project portrays my current skill set in React. You are able
							to filter rooms by different search parameters, from price to the
							exact room size needed. The main goal in creating this project was
							to get an in depth understanding of React, especially the Context
							API - how it manages global application state in the React app.
							<br />
							<br />
							Furthermore, in order to get the project live, Contentful was
							used. This allowed me to easily create, manage and publish content
							to my live website. I chose this route because it was less time
							consuming compared to wiring up my own backend in order to manage
							the content. Contentful made the whole process of publishing my
							website with any updates much more time efficient.
							<br />

							- JavaScript. <br />
							- JSX <br />
							- React - Context API <br />
							- Styled Components <br />
							- Node.js <br />

							<h2 class="text-secondary">Netflix:</h2>
						</div>
						<p>
							A Netflix clone developed using React, including React Hooks. This
							project was created to get a lot of use with react hooks when
							managing state. The 2 hooks that were predominantly used are:
							useState and useEffect. "useState" was used in order to store the
							state to later manipualte it. In order to store the initial state
							and later modify it, useState hook allowed me to use it inside the
							existing function component, rather than coverting it to a class
							component. "useEffect" hook allowed me to replace all component
							lifecycle methods with this one hook.
							<br />
							<br />
							Furthermore, in order to get the project live, Firebase was used.
							This allowed me to easily create, manage and publish content to my
							live website. I chose this route because it was less time
							consuming compared to wiring up my own backend in order to manage
							the content. Firebase made the whole process of publishing my
							website with any updates much more time efficient.

							- JavaScript. <br />
							- JSX <br />
							- React - React Hooks<br />
							- Node.js <br />
							- VSCode. <br />
